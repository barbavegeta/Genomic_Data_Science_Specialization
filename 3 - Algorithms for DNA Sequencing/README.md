# Algorithms for DNA Sequencing (Course 3)

This folder contains my solutions and notes for **Course 3 – Algorithms for DNA Sequencing** from the Johns Hopkins Genomic Data Science Specialization.

The focus here is on implementing classic algorithms and data structures for analysing DNA sequencing data using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## Contents

Typical contents include:

- Jupyter notebooks implementing:
  - String matching and pattern search
  - Overlap and De Bruijn graph–based genome assembly
  - Read alignment and basic error handling
- Python scripts with helper functions for working with FASTA / FASTQ files
- Any small input files provided with the course (where size and licensing allow)

File names are kept close to the original course structure so it’s easy to match them to the lectures/assignments.

## How to run

1. Activate the Python environment described in the root `README.md` (e.g. conda env `genomic-data-science`).
2. From the repo root, start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
